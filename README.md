## Project Information
**Project Title**: **Building and Analyzing a Bicycle Business Data Warehouse**  
**Dataset**: [Europe Bike Store Sales | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prepinstaprime/europe-bike-store-sales)

## Summary
The project will begin by using an existing dataset. Subsequently, a data warehouse schema will be designed. SQL Server Data Tools for SSIS will then be employed to construct the data warehouse based on this schema. Following the construction of the data warehouse, SSAS within the same toolset will be utilized for analysis and reporting. These reports will utilize MDX, pivot tables in MS Excel, and Power BI for advanced data visualization and analysis purposes. 
Finally, data mining techniques will be applied to the data warehouse to forecast future revenue trends.
